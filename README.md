## Lettuce biomass estimation using image-derived features and machine learning. 

Group 11: Jonathan S. Cardenas. 

This repository implements a machine learning strategy to improve the estimation
of leaf fresh weight to automatically quantify lettuce biomass response to environment 
modulation through greenhouse experiments.

GOALS:
- Improve predictability of biomass by adding a finer structural description of 
plant canopy.
